# Shopify - Web Engineer Challenge - Summer 2019

## User Stories

Build a web app to search for waste items using the Toronto Waste Wizard database, and save frequently used ones.

## Instructions
- Reproduce the design as provided in the screenshot, which displays example search results.
- The data must be taken from the [Waste Wizard Lookup data (JSON)](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#5ed40494-a290-7807-d5da-09ab6a56fca2).
- Typing in the search field should *NOT* perform an API call.
- A search must be performed when hitting enter or clicking the search button.
- When the search input field is cleared, the list of results should also be cleared. 
- Performing a search should render a list of potential matching items based on keywords. Each item should:
   - Render the title and description of the item.
   - Render a grey star button *if the item is not already favourited*.
   - Render a green star icon *if the item is not already favourited*.
   - Clicking the star button should add the item to the favourites list.
- When the number of favourites is more than one, the app should render a list of items. Each saved item should:
   - Render the title and description of the item.
   - Render a green star button *if the item has been favourited*.
   - Clicking the green star button should remove the item from the saved list.

1. A link to your codebase, for review.
2. A link to a hosted version, for testing.

=========================================================

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
